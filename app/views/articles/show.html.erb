  <p class="story-content-1">You Shouldn't Accept Period Pain & Discomfort As Normal, Explains Expert, Alice Broster</p>
  <br>
  <p class="story-content">"One of the biggest issues I have is that we're led to believe pain, discomfort and all unpleasant symptoms are totally normal. Unfortunately, this way of thinking means that so many women just grit their teeth through their periods but it just shouldn't be this way," says Nutritional Therapist and founder of the online platform The Female Health Hub Jodie Brandman"</p>
  <br>
  <p class="story-content">According to research, 90% of people experience some side effects during their period. Up to 40% said the pain they experience is so severe they've had to miss school or work. Knowing what's normal for you is so important but if you need help managing your period you should speak to your clinician. The normalization of pain during your bleed can lead to people going undiagnosed for conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Brandman says, "intense cramping is not okay and having really irregular cycles is also an indicator that our body isn't happy."</p>
  <br>
    <p class="story-content">Endometriosis is when uterine tissue grows outside the uterus. It’s estimated that 176 million people worldwide suffer from endometriosis from the time they start their period until menopause.
  <br>
  <p class="story-content">According to the National Institute of Health, 70% of white women and 80% of African American women will be affected by fibroids by the age of 50. One in three people will experience symptoms that can include heavy and painful periods, lower back and abdominal pain and pain or discomfort during sex. Brandman says, “a diagnosis usually requires scans, laparoscopy or a biopsy. Please don’t panic though and ask Dr. Google as these signs can be related to other smaller issues too, so just run anything past your actual doctor first.”
